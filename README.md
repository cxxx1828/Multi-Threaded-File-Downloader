This project implements a multithreaded TCP client–server system for segmented file downloading. The client reads the size of a local file, allows the user to define arbitrary segment lengths, and downloads each segment in parallel through independent threads, each requesting a specific byte range from the server. The server handles multiple clients concurrently using pthreads and enforces a configurable bandwidth limit during transmission. All downloaded segments are reassembled into a final output file, demonstrating parallel networking, custom segmentation, socket programming, and rate-limited data transfer in C.
